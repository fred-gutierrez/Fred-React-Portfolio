        This project is based on my advertising startup, with it, I was able to
        improve my {WordPress} skills, I created this website with the base
        editor from {WordPress} and without a layout template. The main plugins
        I used were Greenshift and Gutenberg.

        This is a working project that I will keep updating from time to time to
        make it a fully working e-commerce page based on {React}. This project
        helped me fully understand {React} props, components, and how to use{" "}
        {TypeScript} rather than regular {JavaScript}.

        This was my first considerable project that allowed me to comprehend and
        sharpen my skills in {CSS}, {Sass}, {HTML}, and {Bootstrap}. The design
        for this page is mostly the same but the reasoning behind doing a new
        portfolio page was due to the chaos I did with the code back then, which
        lead to performance, maintainability, and re-usability issues. Therefore
        this portfolio is made with {React} props, components, and more.
