        This project is based on my advertising startup, with it, I was able to
        improve my {WordPress} skills, I created this website with the base
        editor from {WordPress} and without a layout template. The main plugins
        I used were Greenshift and Gutenberg.

        This is a working project that I will keep updating from time to time to
        make it a fully working e-commerce page based on {React}. This project
        helped me fully understand {React} props, components, and how to use{" "}
        {TypeScript} rather than regular {JavaScript}.

        switcher.
