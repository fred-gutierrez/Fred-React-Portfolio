          Hello there! I’m Fred David, Web Developer/Programmer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I’m a Front-end developer, aiming to learn as much as possible in the
          front-end part to then long-term aim at being considered a Full-stack
          developer with the projects I make along the way and the Back-end
          languages I learn.
          <br />
          <br />I specialize on JavaScript, and I’m very invested in making code
          as efficient as possible to further enhance productivity individually
          and team-based.
        </p>
